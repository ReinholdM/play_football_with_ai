env = leduc_holdem.env(fixed_player=True)
run(
    agent_mapping_func=lambda agent_id: agent_id,
    env_description={
        "creator": leduc_holdem.env,
        "config": {"fixed_player": True},
        "id": "leduc_holdem",
        "possible_agents": env.possible_agents,
    },
    training={
        "interface": {

            "action_spaces": env.action_spaces
        },
    },
    algorithms={
        "PSRO_PPO": {
